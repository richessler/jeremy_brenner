 			<h2>Home.</h2>
 			<img class="about-img1" src="IMG/florida.png" align="center">
 				<p class="about-text">The glorious sunshine state. Home to retirees and crazy people alike. After spending the first 24 years of my life in this swamp, I finally moved from Tampa, Florida to begin a new life in the west. One summer after finishing a research grant at the Univrsity of South Florida, I filled my car with everything that would fit and drove across the country!</p>

 			<h2>Work.</h2>
 			<img class="about-img2" src="IMG/science.jpg" align="center">
 				<p class="about-text">My work experience is primarily in science: biochemistry, research, and neuropharmacology. Out of all the work ive been a part of- I would say research is my favorite. That being said, research is a hard field to find work in, so most of my experience is in medical pathology; blood, guts, all that fun stuff. The picture above is an image of stained brain tissue, for which I developed the protocol.</p>

 			<h2>Life.</h2>
 			<img class="about-img3" src="IMG/buddy1.jpg" align="center">
 				<p class="about-text">When I'm not worrying about my next step in life, I try to enjoy my place here in the bay. As a native to Florida, mountains are a real change- and so I enjoy hiking the parks, gaming of all kinds and varieties, comics, computers, and the odd random hobby such as calligraphy.</p>
